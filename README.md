This project is a clone of the popular educational website W3Schools, created using only HTML and CSS. The purpose of this project is to demonstrate my ability to build a static, responsive, and visually accurate replica of W3Schools' design and layout. By meticulously replicating the structure and styles, this project showcases fundamental web development skills and a keen eye for detail. Feel free to explore the code, suggest improvements, and learn how classic web interfaces are built from the ground up.
